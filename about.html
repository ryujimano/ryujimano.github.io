            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>My name is Ryuji Mano, and I am a first year student at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I have a passion for programming, and I love developing iOS apps and learning Swift. I enjoy attending hackathons and working with people that have the same passions as I do.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Besides programming, I love to run. I am a member of the Purdue Running Club and enjoy participating in cross country, track, and road races.</p>
