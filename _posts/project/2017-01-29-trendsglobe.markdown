#### Twitter Trends Globe

Data visualization of all available trending locations of the Twitter API using WebGL Globe

Built with Python Flask


<br/>
This web page displays a globe with all of the available trend locations provided by the Twitter API. This globe makes it easier to visualize which locations are currently available for accessing trend data. This globe can also be used to see which locations are still not available for access, and this may be useful for developers to see which locations are still in need of trending data access.
