#### Flicks

iOS App that Displays the Current Movie Showings

Built using Swift


<br/>
This app shows all of the current movie showings using The Movie Database API and icons from <a href="https://iconmonstr.com">iconmonstr</a>.
<br />
All movies can be viewed by a collection view of posters or a table view of movies with descriptions.
